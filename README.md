### algorithms project

#### Input file:
  * __Line 1:__         _n_, _c_    // n is the size of the problem (the total number of items) and C is the total weight limit.
  * __Lines 2 to n+1:__ _wi_, _pi_  // wi is the weight of item i and pi is the profit of item i

#### Output file:
  * __Line 1:__ _the size of the problem_ (i.e., the total number of items), _the optimal value_ (i.e., the maximum profit), _the size (k) of the first optimal solution found_ (i.e., the size of the first optimal subset of items found to produce the maximum profit).
  * __Lines 2 to 2+(k-1):__ the _weight_ and _profit_ of an item selected of an optimal solution.
